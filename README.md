# MAZE
## Final Java Project - Telecom

Author: Hugo PEYRON

Certain part of the project required to test the code.

To do so, the `JUNIT` library (version 5) was used. It's one of the
depencies of the project. 

If you have `maven` installed, you can run the tests with the
following command:

    mvn test


REMARKS: 
- The UI part of the code has not been developped by myself
- The project contains a `data` folder that is used to store the
  maze files. At the time of the writing of this file, this folder contains only one demo file.
